## Experience
**[Chronos](https://chronoslany.com/) - Open Source Developer Tool (_Oct. 2023 - Current_)**
- Developed a microservices-based application architecture using TypeScript, enabling independent scaling of each service with static typing for faster error detection during development and enhanced tooling for better maintainability post development
- Conducted Test-Driven Development in Supertest with its specialized design in HTTP assertions enabling seamless testing of API endpoints and supporting integration testing between microservices
- Containerized each microservice application with Docker, providing portability, consistency, and scalability for seamless deployment in diverse environments with 30% faster runtime
- Developed a custom HTTP request handler using Axios that communicates with specified API endpoints handling response and error interceptors for enhanced functionality, and supporting credentials with secure communication. 
- Utilized React Router for a component-based structure and declaratively presents routing logic and centralize configuration
- Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from containerized application and visualize container health in Grafana dashboard
- Achieved faster development using Vite with hot module replacement server and on-demand loading to reduce bundle size

**Senior Business Analyst @ Capital One (_Feb 2022 - Oct 2023_)**
- Delivers high value data, analysis, & reporting solutions to support company's flagship digital servicing platform, which is used by over 40 million monthly active users and supported by over 500 internal software engineers
- Wrote complex SQL queries in Snowflake and Python scripts in Databricks to automatically extract, transform and load (ETL) datasets from AWS S3 data warehouse into a easily accessible format for analysis across over 100+ analysts among the enterprise
- Created Tableau and Quicksight dashboards related to resiliency efforts, internal users, technology changes to promote data driven actionable business insights across stakeholders and C-suite leadership resulted in 20% increase in team performance
- Developed ordinal logistic regression model with mobile platform user data which identified improvement oppotunities on promoting/detracting features that contributed to 25% increase on user popularity
  
**Data Analyst @ Centurion Health (_Jan 2020 - Jan 2022_)**
- Developed automated data pineline in SAS to collect, clean and store millions of patients claim and prescription data, which reduced data mining turn around time by 50%
  
## Data Science Projects
#### Research Assistant for <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/algorithms-threat-detection-atd">Algorithms for Threat Detection</a> Project
-	Used Markov Random Field to build logistic regression models from 911 call data during 2015 Baltimore riots
-	Applied pseudo-likelihood estimation to maximize essential parameters to detect change-point 
-	Predicted possibility of large-scale violence through detection of change-points in Markov Chains

#### [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/ZhongyanLiang/ML-Project-with-Multinomial-Logistic-Regression-Model/blob/main/README.md) with Multinomial Logistic Regression Model
- Built multinomial logistic regression model to assess wine quality (rank from 1-10) with variables such as residual sugar, alcohol, and density etc.
- Conducted tests such as VIF, Stepwise Variables Selection, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant analysis, KNN, and Random Forest to cross-validate and further optimize the model

#### [Machine Learning | Credit Card Fraud Detection]() with random forest model
- Built a Random Forest model to quickly detect anomaly and classify fraudulent transaction
- AUPRC was utilized to measure model accuracy because of unbalanced data
  
## Education
- Biostatistics, M.S. | American University (_May 2022_)
- Food Science, B.S. | University of Maryland (_May 2018_)
- Developed linear regression model to predict prescription demand by evaluating patient and prescriber prescription patterns, which helped avoid prescription supply insufficiency across facilities
